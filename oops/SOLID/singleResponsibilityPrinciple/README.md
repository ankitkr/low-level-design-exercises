## Problem Statement: Employee Management System Refactoring

The challenge at hand revolves around the efficient management of employee data within an organizational context. Each employee possesses distinct attributes, including their name and salary. Additionally, employees fall into two primary categories: full-time and part-time. Notably, part-time employees dedicate 20 hours per week to work, while their full-time counterparts commit 40 hours weekly.

The organizational data is structured and maintained by a repository class, serving as a repository for the list of employees. The focal point is the main class, denoted as `SaveEmployeesMain`. This class plays a crucial role in fetching the employee list and persisting it into a file. Importantly, the file format employed for storage is customizable based on specific requirements.

Moreover, a significant aspect of this refactoring initiative involves the strategic integration of comprehensive logging mechanisms. These logs are strategically placed to provide insightful information at critical points in the program execution. This addition is indispensable for facilitating effective debugging, monitoring, and auditing processes.

**In summary, the challenge necessitates a meticulous refactoring of the existing employee management system. Key elements include the segregation of employee types, customization of file storage formats, and the judicious integration of logging mechanisms at appropriate junctures. The overarching goal is to enhance the system's flexibility, maintainability, and overall efficacy.**
